            <p>This information package is designed to provide you with some information about distress intolerance and
                suggested strategies for managing distressing or uncomfortable feelings more effectively.</p>
            <h2>Module 1: Understanding Distress Tolerance</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    We all experience emotions. Emotions are an important part of being human, and are essential to our
                    survival. As humans we are designed to feel a whole range of emotions, some of which may be
                    comfortable to us, and others may be uncomfortable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people dislike feeling uncomfortable. There are many different ways that humans can feel
                    uncomfortable…we can be hot, cold, tired, in pain, hungry, unwell, and the list could go on. The
                    type of discomfort we will be talking about in these modules is emotional discomfort, or what is
                    often called <em>distress</em>. We may not like it, but experiencing uncomfortable emotions is a
                    natural part of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is a difference between disliking unpleasant emotions, but nevertheless accepting
                    that they are an inevitable part of life and hence riding through them, versus experiencing
                    unpleasant emotions as unbearable and needing to get rid of them. Some people tell us that they
                    “can’t face”, “can’t bear”, “can't stand”, or “can't tolerate” emotional distress. Being intolerant
                    of experiencing emotional discomfort can actually breed a whole bunch of problems, as it interferes
                    with living a fulfilling life, and can make worse any emotional discomfort we might be experiencing.
                    If difficulty facing your feelings or tolerating distress sounds like you, then read on to learn
                    ways to overcome this pattern.

                <h3>What is Distress Intolerance?</h3>
                <p> There are many different definitions of distress intolerance. What we mean by distress intolerance
                    is a <strong>perceived inability to fully experience unpleasant, aversive or uncomfortable emotions,
                        and is accompanied by a desperate need to escape the uncomfortable emotions.</strong>
                    Difficulties tolerating distress are often linked to a fear of experiencing negative emotion. Often
                    distress intolerance centres on high intensity emotional experiences, that is, when the emotion is
                    ‘hot’, strong and powerful (e.g., intense despair after an argument with a loved one, or intense
                    fear whilst giving a speech). </p>
                <p> However, it could also occur for lower intensity emotions (e.g., nervousness about an upcoming
                    medical examination, sadness when remembering a past relationship break-up). It is not the intensity
                    of the emotion itself, but how much you fear it, how unpleasant it feels to you, how unbearable it
                    seems, and how much you want to get away from it, that determines if you are intolerant of distress.
                </p>
                <p> There are varying types of negative emotions that could potentially be distressing for people. We
                    thought it might be helpful to categorise these emotions into the following 3 clusters: </p>
                <h4>The Sad</h4>
                <p> This group includes emotions that reflect sadness at varying degrees of intensity. This would
                    include disappointment, hurt, despair, guilt, shame, sadness, depression, grief, misery, etc. These
                    emotions can be accompanied by either low physiological arousal (e.g., low energy, fatigue,
                    heaviness) or heightened physiological arousal (e.g., intense crying, restlessness), thoughts of
                    hopelessness, loss, regret and inadequacy, and the urge to hide away from life. </p>
                <h4>The Mad</h4>
                <p> This group includes emotions that reflect anger at varying degrees of intensity. This would include
                    irritation, agitation, frustration, disgust, jealousy, anger, rage, hatred, etc. These emotions are
                    usually accompanied by high physiological arousal (e.g., tension, increased heart rate, feeling
                    sweaty or hot, etc), thoughts of unfairness, injustice and wrong doing, and the urge to lash out in
                    some way. </p>
                <h4>The Scared</h4>
                <p> This group includes emotions that reflect fear at varying degrees of intensity. This would include
                    nervousness, anxiety, dread, fear, panic, terror, etc. These emotions are usually accompanied by
                    high physiological arousal (e.g., increased heart rate, increased breathing, tension, sweating,
                    shaking, butterflies in stomach, etc), thoughts of threat, vulnerability and helplessness, and the
                    urge to avoid or escape. </p>
                <section class="activity">
                    <h3>Reflection activity</h3>
                    <p>For some people their distress intolerance might be very broad, in that they find all negative
                        emotions distressing, for other people their distress intolerance might be very select to just
                        one type of emotion (e.g., anxiety). How about you? What <strong>negative emotions</strong> do
                        you find difficult to deal with? </p>
                    <p class="note"> <strong>Note:</strong> Some people can be distressed by positive emotions, not just
                        the negative ones. It is not uncommon for people to be concerned that positive emotions will
                        make them lose control in some way. These modules will only focus on intolerance related to
                        negative emotions, but some of the strategies may be relevant if you have trouble experiencing
                        positive emotions too. </p>
                </section>
                <p> It is important to realise that the term <em>distress</em> that we are using throughout these
                    modules, refers to emotions that are experienced as aversive, unpleasant, uncomfortable and
                    upsetting. Now, the 3 clusters of negative emotion previously mentioned, are not necessarily in
                    themselves distressing. For example, some people like the empowering feeling of being angry, and
                    don't find it at all an upsetting emotion. Some people like watching horror movies because they
                    enjoy the feeling of being scared. Some people don't mind feeling sad, because it gets their
                    creative energy going when it comes to art, music or writing, or they may hold the attitude “it's
                    good to have a cry every now and then”. These examples show that <strong>negative emotion in itself
                        is not necessarily distressing</strong>, and as you will see in the next module, these emotions
                    are normal and often helpful to us. <strong>We only begin to feel distressed when we evaluate our
                        emotional experience as a bad thing.</strong> </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>The Paradox</h3>
                <p> Now, it makes a lot of sense to try to get away from things that feel unpleasant. This strategy
                    seems to work for other things that make us uncomfortable (e.g., heat, cold, pain, hunger, etc).
                    However, when we apply the same strategy to our emotions, it seems to backfire. This is the
                    paradoxical nature of distress intolerance. That is, <strong> the more we fear, struggle with, and
                        try to avoid any form of distress, generally the worse that distress gets. </strong> Our fear
                    and avoidance of the distress actually magnifies the distress.</p>
                <p>
                    Imagine your emotional distress is a puddle of water blocking your path. If you can recognise that
                    emotional distress is not something to be feared, nor something to run away from, then all you have
                    is a puddle of water. If you just wait there it will eventually dry up enough to jump over it, or
                    you could just splash through it and keep on going. However, if instead you fear your distress,
                    struggle with it and try everything to escape from it, all you do is add more and more water to the
                    puddle, and very soon you are faced with a deep pond that it impossible to jump over or splash
                    through. The bigger the pond, the harder to find a way through it, and hence the longer you will
                    feel stuck and unable to move forward.
