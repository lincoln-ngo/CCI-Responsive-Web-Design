            <p>This information package is designed to provide you with some information about distress intolerance and
                suggested strategies for managing distressing or uncomfortable feelings more effectively.</p>
            <h2>Module 1: Understanding Distress Tolerance</h2>
            <section>
                <h3>Introduction</h3>
                <p>
                    We all experience emotions. Emotions are an important part of being human, and are essential to our
                    survival. As humans we are designed to feel a whole range of emotions, some of which may be
                    comfortable to us, and others may be uncomfortable.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Most people dislike feeling uncomfortable. There are many different ways that humans can feel
                    uncomfortable…we can be hot, cold, tired, in pain, hungry, unwell, and the list could go on. The
                    type of discomfort we will be talking about in these modules is emotional discomfort, or what is
                    often called <em>distress</em>. We may not like it, but experiencing uncomfortable emotions is a
                    natural part of life.
                </p>
                <p>
                    However, there is a difference between disliking unpleasant emotions, but nevertheless accepting
                    that they are an inevitable part of life and hence riding through them, versus experiencing
                    unpleasant emotions as unbearable and needing to get rid of them. Some people tell us that they
                    "can't face", "can't bear", "can't stand", or "can't tolerate" emotional distress. Being intolerant
                    of experiencing emotional discomfort can actually breed a whole bunch of problems, as it interferes
                    with living a fulfilling life, and can make worse any emotional discomfort we might be experiencing.
                    If difficulty facing your feelings or tolerating distress sounds like you, then read on to learn
                    ways to overcome this pattern.

            <section>
                <h3>What is Distress Intolerance?</h3>
                <p> There are many different definitions of distress intolerance. What we mean by distress intolerance
                    is a <strong>perceived inability to fully experience unpleasant, aversive or uncomfortable emotions,
                        and is accompanied by a desperate need to escape the uncomfortable emotions.</strong>
                    Difficulties tolerating distress are often linked to a fear of experiencing negative emotion. Often
                    distress intolerance centres on high intensity emotional experiences, that is, when the emotion is
                    'hot', strong and powerful (e.g., intense despair after an argument with a loved one, or intense
                    fear whilst giving a speech). </p>
                <p> However, it could also occur for lower intensity emotions (e.g., nervousness about an upcoming
                    medical examination, sadness when remembering a past relationship break-up). It is not the intensity
                    of the emotion itself, but how much you fear it, how unpleasant it feels to you, how unbearable it
                    seems, and how much you want to get away from it, that determines if you are intolerant of distress.
                </p>
                <p> There are varying types of negative emotions that could potentially be distressing for people. We
                    thought it might be helpful to categorise these emotions into the following 3 clusters: </p>
                <h4>The Sad</h4>
                <p> This group includes emotions that reflect sadness at varying degrees of intensity. This would
                    include disappointment, hurt, despair, guilt, shame, sadness, depression, grief, misery, etc. These
                    emotions can be accompanied by either low physiological arousal (e.g., low energy, fatigue,
                    heaviness) or heightened physiological arousal (e.g., intense crying, restlessness), thoughts of
                    hopelessness, loss, regret and inadequacy, and the urge to hide away from life. </p>
                <h4>The Mad</h4>
                <p> This group includes emotions that reflect anger at varying degrees of intensity. This would include
                    irritation, agitation, frustration, disgust, jealousy, anger, rage, hatred, etc. These emotions are
                    usually accompanied by high physiological arousal (e.g., tension, increased heart rate, feeling
                    sweaty or hot, etc), thoughts of unfairness, injustice and wrong doing, and the urge to lash out in
                    some way. </p>
                <h4>The Scared</h4>
                <p> This group includes emotions that reflect fear at varying degrees of intensity. This would include
                    nervousness, anxiety, dread, fear, panic, terror, etc. These emotions are usually accompanied by
                    high physiological arousal (e.g., increased heart rate, increased breathing, tension, sweating,
                    shaking, butterflies in stomach, etc), thoughts of threat, vulnerability and helplessness, and the
                    urge to avoid or escape. </p>
                <section class="activity">
                    <h3>Reflection activity</h3>
                    <p>For some people their distress intolerance might be very broad, in that they find all negative
                        emotions distressing, for other people their distress intolerance might be very select to just
                        one type of emotion (e.g., anxiety). How about you? What <strong>negative emotions</strong> do
                        you find difficult to deal with? </p>
                    <p class="note"> <strong>Note:</strong> Some people can be distressed by positive emotions, not just
                        the negative ones. It is not uncommon for people to be concerned that positive emotions will
                        make them lose control in some way. These modules will only focus on intolerance related to
                        negative emotions, but some of the strategies may be relevant if you have trouble experiencing
                        positive emotions too. </p>
                </section>
                <p> It is important to realise that the term <em>distress</em> that we are using throughout these
                    modules, refers to emotions that are experienced as aversive, unpleasant, uncomfortable and
                    upsetting. Now, the 3 clusters of negative emotion previously mentioned, are not necessarily in
                    themselves distressing. For example, some people like the empowering feeling of being angry, and
                    don't find it at all an upsetting emotion. Some people like watching horror movies because they
                    enjoy the feeling of being scared. Some people don't mind feeling sad, because it gets their
                    creative energy going when it comes to art, music or writing, or they may hold the attitude "it's
                    good to have a cry every now and then". These examples show that <strong>negative emotion in itself
                        is not necessarily distressing</strong>, and as you will see in the next module, these emotions
                    are normal and often helpful to us. <strong>We only begin to feel distressed when we evaluate our
                        emotional experience as a bad thing.</strong> </p>
            </section>
            <section>
                <h3>The Paradox</h3>
                <p> Now, it makes a lot of sense to try to get away from things that feel unpleasant. This strategy
                    seems to work for other things that make us uncomfortable (e.g., heat, cold, pain, hunger, etc).
                    However, when we apply the same strategy to our emotions, it seems to backfire. This is the
                    paradoxical nature of distress intolerance. That is, <strong> the more we fear, struggle with, and
                        try to avoid any form of distress, generally the worse that distress gets. </strong> Our fear
                    and avoidance of the distress actually magnifies the distress.</p>
                <p>
                    Imagine your emotional distress is a puddle of water blocking your path. If you can recognise that
                    emotional distress is not something to be feared, nor something to run away from, then all you have
                    is a puddle of water. If you just wait there it will eventually dry up enough to jump over it, or
                    you could just splash through it and keep on going. However, if instead you fear your distress,
                    struggle with it and try everything to escape from it, all you do is add more and more water to the
                    puddle, and very soon you are faced with a deep pond that it impossible to jump over or splash
                    through. The bigger the pond, the harder to find a way through it, and hence the longer you will
                    feel stuck and unable to move forward.

                <h3>Am I Distress Intolerant?</h3>
                <p>
                    If you are still a bit unclear as to whether distress intolerance is a problem for you, take a look
                    at the following statements. Note down the statements you <em>strongly agree</em> with.
                </p>
                <ul class="body-text-list">
                    <li>Feeling distressed or upset is unbearable to me</li>
                    <li>When I feel distressed or upset, all I can think about is how bad I feel</li>
                    <li>I can't handle feeling distressed or upset</li>
                    <li>My feelings of distress are so intense that they completely take over</li>
                    <li>There is nothing worse than feeling distressed or upset</li>
                    <li>I don't tolerate being distressed or upset as well as most people</li>
                    <li>My feelings of distress or being upset are not acceptable</li>
                    <li>I'll do anything to avoid feel distressed or upset</li>
                    <li>Other people seem to be able to tolerate feeling distressed or upset better than I can</li>
                    <li>Being distressed or upset is always a major ordeal for me</li>
                    <li>I am ashamed of myself when I feel distressed or upset</li>
                    <li>My feelings of distress or being upset scare me</li>
                    <li>I'll do anything to stop feeling distressed or upset</li>
                    <li>When I feel distressed or upset, I must do something about it immediately</li>
                    <li>When I feel distressed or upset, I cannot help but concentrate on how bad the distress actually
                        feels</li>
                </ul>
                <p class="in-text-reference">The above statements are an adaptation of the Distress Tolerance Scale
                    (Simons & Gaher, 2005)</p>
                <p>If you find yourself agreeing with a lot of the above statements, then this can be a sign of having
                    difficulties with tolerating emotional distress.</p>
                <p>
                    To get an even better idea if distress intolerance is a problem in your life, keep a tally over the
                    next week or so of any negative emotions you feel. Then make a rating of how intolerable (i.e.,
                    unbearable, unmanageable) these feelings were for you. Also note how you reacted to these emotions
                    (i.e., Did you frantically try to stop the feeling? Did you ride it out? Did you do things that
                    seemed helpful or unhelpful to coping with the emotion?). You could use a notepad to keep track of
                    these things, and it might look something like the example below. After having tuned in closely to
                    how you tolerate negative emotions, you may then be in a better position to assess if distress
                    intolerance is a problem for you.

                <h3>Healthy Distress Tolerance</h3>
                <p>
                    An important thing to consider when assessing your own level of distress tolerance, is that like
                    many things in life, doing anything at the extreme can be unhelpful. Think of distress tolerance as
                    a continuum where at one end people can be extremely intolerant of distress, and at the other end
                    people can be extremely tolerant of distress. Sitting at either end of the spectrum isn't good for
                    you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    If you were always overly tolerant of experiencing all unpleasant emotions, then problems might
                    result such as tolerating bad situations or bad people in your life. If you were tolerant in the
                    extreme, you would never take action to change unhappy circumstances in your life that need to be
                    changed. As you read through the rest of this module, you will get a sense of all the negative
                    consequences that occur on the other side of the spectrum when people are intolerant of distress.
                    When working through these modules we will be aiming for somewhere in the middle of the continuum,
                    so that you learn to balance tolerating emotional discomfort when it does arise, with taking action
                    to improve your emotional experiences.
                </p>
                <p>
                    You might like to consider where you think you are on this continuum at the moment.

                <h3>How Does Distress Intolerance Develop?</h3>
                <p>
                    It is likely a combination of biological and environmental factors that lead some people to be more
                    intolerant of emotional distress than others.
                </p>
                <p>
                    There is some suggestion that biologically some people are more sensitive to negative emotions,
                    experiencing negative emotions more easily, at a higher level of intensity, and for a longer
                    duration than other people. This may mean that some people experience negative emotions as more
                    painful, and hence have greater difficulty coping with the experience.
                </p>
                <p>
                    It is likely your experiences growing up through childhood, adolescence and through adult life, may
                    shape how you deal with emotions. Some people may not have been shown ways to tolerate emotional
                    discomfort appropriately, for example being punished for expressing normal emotions like crying when
                    they were sad. Others may have only been shown unhelpful ways of dealing with their emotions, such
                    as seeing a loved one use alcohol to deal with their own emotions.
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, if we have stumbled upon unhelpful ways to escape our emotions, these methods may have been
                    reinforced by temporarily making us feel better. As such, we keep using unhelpful methods and don't
                    have a reason to look for other more helpful ways of dealing with our distress.

                <h3>Distress Intolerant Beliefs</h3>
                <p>
                    Regardless of how a person's distress intolerance emerged, we take the view that this intolerance
                    keeps having a hold over people's lives due to certain beliefs they have developed about
                    experiencing negative emotions. These beliefs tend to centre on the notion that negative emotion is
                    bad in some way, unbearable, unacceptable, or will lead to disastrous consequences. These beliefs
                    tend to make any negative emotion that we may feel, become a highly distressing emotional
                    experience. Below are some of the common beliefs that people with distress intolerance have when
                    they start to experience negative emotion:
                </p>
                <ul class="body-text-list">
                    <li>I can't stand this</li>
                    <li>It's unbearable</li>
                    <li>I hate this feeling</li>
                    <li>I must stop this feeling</li>
                    <li>I must get rid of it</li>
                    <li>Take it away</li>
                    <li>I can't cope with this feeling</li>
                    <li>I will lose control</li>
                    <li>I'll go crazy</li>
                    <li>This feeling will keep going on forever</li>
                    <li>It is wrong to feel this way</li>
                    <li>It's stupid and unacceptable</li>
                    <li>It's weak</li>
                    <li>It's bad</li>
                    <li>It's dangerous</li>

                <h3>Distress Escape Methods</h3>
                <p>
                    As mentioned earlier, a clear sign of distress intolerance is when someone takes desperate urgent
                    measures to escape or get rid of uncomfortable emotions. This can be done in a number of different
                    ways, and each way can lead to significant problems in a person's life.
                </p>
                <h4>Avoidance</h4>
                <p>
                    One method is via avoidance, and avoidance can take many forms. Firstly, there is
                    <strong>situational avoidance</strong>. This is when you avoid any situation, scenario, place,
                    person, cue or activity that you know is likely to bring on distressing emotions. Examples of this
                    might be avoiding a particular family member with whom you become angry, avoiding studying because
                    you become frustrated, avoiding socialising or leaving the house because you become anxious,
                    avoiding things that change your physical state because you feel nervous (e.g., sitting in a hot
                    car, drinking caffeine), avoiding medical appointments or tests because you are frightened, or
                    avoiding reminders of the past or certain topics of conversation because they sadden you.
                </p>
                <p>
                    A second method, is a more subtle form of avoidance known as <strong>reassurance seeking or
                        checking</strong>. This is when you try to quickly allay your distressing emotions by
                    <em>excessively</em> seeking reassurance from other people or engaging in some repetitive checking
                    behaviour. Checking or reassurance seeking temporarily brings you comfort and takes away your
                    distress, but the relief is short lived and you have to keep doing these things the next time you
                    feel distressed. Examples might include having to repetitively check things on your body (e.g., a
                    physical sensation, symptom or feature) or in your environment (e.g., around the home),
                    over-preparing for things (e.g., projects, work, social events), keeping things in excessive order,
                    or overly questioning or consulting other people's opinions to calm you down (i.e., family, friends,
                    medical or mental health professionals, internet research).
                </p>
                <p>
                    Finally, there is a third method called <strong>distraction and suppression</strong> which involves
                    trying to push away the distress, rather than sitting with the emotion and feeling what needs to be
                    felt (i.e., telling yourself to "stop it" as soon as you feel any distress, finding any mental or
                    physical activity to distract yourself from the slightest hint of emotion such as counting or
                    repeating positive statements, etc). The problem with distraction and suppression is that you can't
                    keep it up for long, and the emotion ends up being like a beach ball you are trying to hold under
                    the water with your hands. You can only hold it at bay for so long, it becomes exhausting, and
                    eventually it pops back up and hits you in the face!
                </p>
                <h4>Numbing and Withdrawing</h4>
                <p>
                    Numbing and withdrawing capture things you do to tune out from the distress. The most common ways of
                    doing this would be by using <strong>alcohol</strong> or <strong>drugs</strong> to escape emotional
                    discomfort. <strong>Binge eating</strong> is also a common method used to try to alleviate distress.
                    <strong>Excessive sleep</strong> can also be used in an unhelpful way to zone out from and escape
                    unpleasant emotions.
                </p>
                <h4>Harmful Releases</h4>
                <p>
                    We have used the term ‘harmful releases’ to capture behaviours we might engage in to release or vent
                    our distress, that are also directly physically damaging to ourselves. Rather than allowing our
                    emotions to run their natural course, we might injure or harm ourselves as a way of stopping the
                    emotional discomfort. Such behaviours might include scratching, picking, biting, punching, hair
                    pulling, head banging, cutting or burning. The degree of harm we cause to ourselves could be minor
                    or major, but the key is that doing harm to ourselves is being used to get rid of distressing
                    emotions.
                </p>
                <p>

                        Please note: Whilst these modules may be helpful to people who use drugs, alcohol or self
                        harm as a means of tolerating emotional distress, it is important to recognise that these are
                        very serious problems in their own right that can cause a person significant harm. We strongly
                        advise seeking help from a GP or mental health professional to address these concerns, rather
                        than relying solely on these Modules to overcome the problem.

                        We have just outlined the most common ways people escape their distress. You may be able to
                        think of other unhelpful methods. The important thing is to recognise your common <em>Distress
                            Escape Methods</em>. Ask yourself, what do I do to get rid of unpleasant emotions? Take some
                        time to jot these down now.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <p>
                    The issue with each of these escape methods is that they only work in the short-term. In the
                    short-term, as soon as you avoid or numb or release yourself, you experience instant relief from
                    whatever distressing emotion you are trying to flee. In this way it may seem like a really good
                    strategy, and that is probably why you have been using it, because there is some pay off. However,
                    over the long-term it all falls apart because:
                </p>
                <ul class="body-text-list">
                    <li>
                        The escape strategy itself is damaging and causes other problems in your life
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Your negative emotions usually worsen because you feel you haven’t coped well
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        By continually using your escape strategy, you never learn other more helpful ways of tolerating
                        emotional distress
                    </li>
                    <li>By continually using your escape strategy you never have the opportunity to stay with the
                        emotional distress and therefore challenge the beliefs you hold about not being able to tolerate
                        negative emotions (maybe you can tolerate them, but you have just never given yourself the
                        chance???)

                <p>
                    Distress usually starts with some sort of trigger which can be big (e.g., a relationship break-up)
                    or small (e.g., watching a distressing story on TV), internal (e.g., noticing a thought, image,
                    memory, emotion, physical sensation, etc) or external (e.g., a certain situation, event, person,
                    place, cue, etc).
                </p>

                    <h3>Reflection activity</h3>
                    <p>
                        Think back to past times you haven’t coped well with distress, what sorts of things were your
                        <em>Triggers</em>? We will look at your triggers in more detail in Module 4.
                    </p>
                </section>
                <p>
                    Whatever the trigger, we start to feel some sort of negative emotion. Now the emotion in and of
                    itself is not necessarily distressing, unless we also hold distress intolerant beliefs which tell us
                    the emotion is bad in some way and must be stopped. As a result of our beliefs, we start to
                    experience the emotion as highly distressing and upsetting to us, and therefore engage in our
                    unhelpful escape methods to stop it. In the short-term this takes the emotional pain away, but in
                    the longterm makes everything much worse.
                </p>
                <p>
                    This chain of events captures what we mean by distress intolerance, and is mapped out in the model
                    below. Try filling in each box to make the model specific to you, so you can see your
                    distress intolerance 'chain'. You will be able to fill in the <span class="bold">Triggers, Negative

                            practice other helpful ways of tolerating distress, by escaping I miss the opportunity to
                            stay with the distress and hence test if my distress intolerant beliefs are actually true.
                            So next time I face a trigger the cycle starts again...

                <h3>The Good News</h3>
                <p>
                    The good news is that it doesn’t have to be this way! No matter how your distress intolerance has
                    come about, no matter what emotions you have trouble dealing with, and no matter how unhelpful your
                    escape methods are, you can learn ways of tolerating distress.
                </p>
                <p>
                    <strong>Distress tolerance is a good life skill for anyone to learn</strong>. Instead of fearing and
                    fighting uncomfortable emotions and desperately trying to get rid of them, these modules we will
                    teach you how to sit with and tolerate emotional distress, such that you learn the emotion will pass
                    and that you can cope.
                </p>
                <p>
                    We will focus on things you can change in the here and now, particularly your escape methods and
                    distress intolerant beliefs. <a href="#">Module 2</a> and <a href="#">Module 3</a> will teach you
                    specific techniques for tolerating distress that focus on both accepting distress and improving
                    distress. <a href="#">Module 4</a> will draw all this work together in a Distress Tolerance Action
                    Plan, and give you ideas for how to practice this plan, which over time will tackle the distress
                    intolerant beliefs that are driving the problem.
                </p>

                    When using self-help materials, some people might skip sections or complete things in a different
                    order. The modules in this information package have been designed to be completed in the order they
                    appear. We recommend that you work through the modules in sequence, finishing each module before
                    moving on to the next one in the series. We believe that by doing this, you will maximise the
                    benefits you might receive from working through this information package.

                    Emotional discomfort is impossible to get rid of, as it is an inevitable part of being human. So we
                    all need to learn how to live with it, and not let our fear of distress restrict how we live our
                    lives. You may have been telling yourself for some time now that you "can't stand it!" But stick
                    with us to find out how you can face your feelings and learn to tolerate your distress.

                <h3>Module Summary</h3>
                <ul class="body-text-list">
                    <li>
                        Distress intolerance is a perceived inability to fully experience unpleasant, aversive or
                        uncomfortable emotions, and is accompanied by a desperate need to escape the uncomfortable
                        emotions.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Sadness, anger and fear are the 3 clusters of negative emotion people may find distressing, and
                        people may have trouble with all negative emotions or just one specific type.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Negative emotion in itself is not necessarily distressing. We begin to feel distressed when we
                        evaluate our emotional experience as aversive.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Distress intolerant beliefs are central to this problem, as people commonly hold beliefs that
                        negative emotion is bad in some way or that experiencing negative emotion will be unbearable or
                        will lead to disastrous consequences.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Avoidance (e.g., situational, reassurance seeking, checking, distraction, suppression), numbing
                        & withdrawing (e.g., alcohol, drugs, binge eating, excessive sleep), and harmful releases (e.g.,
                        self injury) are common unhelpful escape methods people use to get rid of emotional distress.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Escaping from distress only works in the short-term. In the long-term the distress gets worse,
                        it creates bigger life problems, and the opportunity is missed to learn healthy ways to tolerate
                        negative emotion or to test if your fears about experiencing negative emotion are truly valid.
                    </li>
                    <li>
                        Emotional distress is impossible to get rid of, as it is an inevitable part of being human.
                        Learning how to tolerate emotional discomfort is an important skill for everyone to learn.

                <p>
                    The concepts and strategies in these modules have been developed from evidence based
                    psychological practice, primarily Cognitive-Behavioural and Mindfulness-Based Therapies. These
                    modules are based on the approach that distress intolerance is a result of problematic
                    cognitions (thoughts) and behaviours.
