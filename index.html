            <h2>Module 1: Understanding Distress Tolerance</h2>
            <h3>Introduction</h3>
            <p>
                We all experience emotions. Emotions are an important part of being human, and are essential to our
                survival. As humans we are designed to feel a whole range of emotions, some of which may be comfortable
                to us, and others may be uncomfortable.
            </p>
            <p>
                Most people dislike feeling uncomfortable. There are many different ways that humans can feel
                uncomfortable…we can be hot, cold, tired, in pain, hungry, unwell, and the list could go on. The type of
                discomfort we will be talking about in these modules is emotional discomfort, or what is often called
                <em>distress</em>. We may not like it, but experiencing uncomfortable emotions is a natural part of
                life.
            </p>
            <p>
                However, there is a difference between disliking unpleasant emotions, but nevertheless accepting that
                they
                are an inevitable part of life and hence riding through them, versus experiencing unpleasant emotions as
                unbearable and needing to get rid of them. Some people tell us that they “can’t face”, “can’t bear”,
                “can’t
                stand”, or “can’t tolerate” emotional distress. Being intolerant of experiencing emotional discomfort
                can
                actually breed a whole bunch of problems, as it interferes with living a fulfilling life, and can make
                worse
                any
                emotional discomfort we might be experiencing. If difficulty facing your feelings or tolerating distress
                sounds like you, then read on to learn ways to overcome this pattern.

            <h3>What is Distress Intolerance?</h3>
            <p>
                There are many different definitions of distress intolerance. What we mean by distress intolerance is a
                <strong>perceived inability to fully experience unpleasant, aversive or uncomfortable emotions, and is
                    accompanied by a desperate need to escape the uncomfortable emotions.</strong> Difficulties
                tolerating
                distress are often linked to a fear of experiencing negative emotion. Often distress intolerance centres
                on
                high intensity emotional experiences, that is, when the emotion is ‘hot’, strong and powerful (e.g.,
                intense
                despair after an argument with a loved one, or intense fear whilst giving a speech).
            </p>
            <p>
                However, it could also occur for lower intensity emotions (e.g., nervousness about an upcoming medical
                examination, sadness when remembering a past relationship break-up). It is not the intensity of the
                emotion itself, but how much you fear it, how unpleasant it feels to you, how unbearable it seems, and
                how
                much you want to get away from it, that determines if you are intolerant of distress.
            </p>
            <p>
                There are varying types of negative emotions that could potentially be distressing for people. We
                thought
                it might be helpful to categorise these emotions into the following 3 clusters:
